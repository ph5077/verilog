1.0 VCS Dynamic Race detection

  The -race compile-time option enables race detection for your 
  entire design. 
  
  The -racecd compile-time option enables race detection for the 
  part of your design that is enclosed between the ‘race and 
  ‘endrace compiler directives.
  
  REPORT：race.out and race.unique.out files. 

  race.out file：a line for all race conditions throughout the simulation.
  If VCS executes two different statements in the same time step for several times
  the race.out file contains a line for each of these times. 

  race.unique.out file：contains only the lines for unique race conditions
  which have not been reported in a previous line.
  
  NOTES:
  The race.unique.out is automatically created by the PostRace.pl Perl script
  This script needs a perl5 interpreter.
  
  
  Post-Processing the Report：PostRace.pl Perl script
  vcdiff：find differences of two VCD files for mismatch with the 
      directory：vcs_install_dir/bin 
      
2.0 The Static Race Detection Tool

  +race=all compile-time option to start the static race detection tool
  for only pure Verilog constructs
  
  File：race.out.static
