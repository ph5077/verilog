Enabling Negative Timing Checks
      To use a negative timing check you must include the +neg_tchk compile-time option
      when you compile your design. If you omit this option, VCS changes all negative limits to 0.
      
The +overlap compile-time option enables accurate simulation of multiple violation windows 
for the same two signals when the following conditions occur:
      • The violation windows are specified with negative delay values that are backannotated from an SDF file.
      • The violation windows do not converge or overlap.
      
The default behavior of VCS when these conditions are met is to replace the negative delay values with zeros
so that the violation windows overlap.

SDF3.0 setuphold supports negative timing check, setup or hold not

Pay attention to if timing check matches btw verilog model, SDF.

+maxdelays
+typdelays
+mindelays
      Specifies using the maximum timing delays in the min:typ:max delay triplets 
      when compiling the SDF file. 
      The mtm_spec argument to the $sdf_annotate system task overrides this option.
